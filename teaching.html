                  “If TA awards exist at Georgetown, Jacob needs to win every single one of them. He is undoubtedly the best TA I have ever had. He is so busy with his own work, and yet he makes time to help students and meet with us several times every week. He holds office hours weekly, and always stays behind if we need extra help. He has never made me feel dumb for asking questions, and always explains things in a very clear and coherent manner. Jacob is literally amazing and I’m so thankful he was our TA this semester.”
